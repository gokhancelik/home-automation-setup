    # By default, Loki will send anonymous, but uniquely-identifiable usage and configuration
    # analytics to Grafana Labs. These statistics are sent to https://stats.grafana.org/
    #
    # Statistics help us better understand how Loki is used, and they show us performance
    # levels for most users. This helps us prioritize features and documentation.
    # For more information on what's sent, look at
    # https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/pkg/usagestats/stats.go
    # Refer to the buildReport method to see what goes into a report.
