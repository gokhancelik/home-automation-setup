## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start Infrastructure**: Run `docker-compose up -d` to start InfluxDB and MQTT broker
2. **Configure Services**: Update connection strings in `appsettings.json` files
3. **Run Gateway**: Use VS Code task "Run Gateway" or `dotnet run --project src/CloudHMI.Gateway`
4. **Run Dashboard**: Use VS Code task "Run Dashboard" or `dotnet run --project src/CloudHMI.Dashboard`
5. **Test Data Flow**: Use `scripts/mqtt-test-publisher.ps1` to simulate PLC data
